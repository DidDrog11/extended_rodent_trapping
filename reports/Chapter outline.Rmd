In this chapter I report a longitudinal rodent trapping study at four study sites in a Lassa fever endemic region of Eastern Sierra Leone. I perform rodent trapping along socio-ecological gradients to understand the association of land use on rodent species assemblages and population structures. I will perform morphological and molecular speciation on sampled rodents to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of rodent species at the selected study sites. Data obtained from this study will be used to inform species occupancy and distribution models in the Eastern province of Sierra Leone. These models can be used to identify regions of interest for further investigation of Lassa fever epidemiology.

# Abstract

*Lassa mammarenavirus*, the causative agent of Lassa fever is endemic to Eastern Sierra Leone. The principal reservoir species (*Mastomys natalensis*), is considered abundant in human dominated habitats, however, rodent species' assemblages are not well described. To investigate the structure of these assemblages in this heterogeneous landscape we conducted three monthly rodent trapping surveys for two years. Study sites were selected to provide coverage of different land classifications of Eastern Sierra Leone in the Lassa fever endemic region. Trapping effort, measured through trap-nights, was consistent across study sites and study visits allowing direct comparison between visits and between study sites. We describe rodent assemblages and their structures through morphological and molecular speciation, age classification, reproductive status and habitat preference. Trapping data was used to produce species distribution maps across this region.

We found that *Mastomys natalensis* displayed seasonal variation in abundance (measured by number of individuals trapped per trap night) and habitat choices with populations concentrated in areas of human habitation during the dry season with minimal radiation to nearby agricultural areas during the wet season. We found that other rodent species within these communities diversify into habitat niches, and that during periods of increased competition for resources (i.e., the dry season), generalist species (e.g. *Mus musculus*, *Rattus rattus* and *Mastomys natalensis*) were more abundant than specialist species. There was good concordance between morphological field based identification and subsequent molecular speciation. Species distribution maps identified areas of expected absence of our species of interest *Matsomys natalensis* and potential discontinuity between populations.

We identify a complex dynamic system within rodent species assemblages co-located with human communities in Eastern Sierra Leone. The hazard of *Lassa mammarenavirus* spillover will be driven by fluctuating populations of host species due to either rodent population numbers (driving increased interaction with human populations) or increased viral transmission within these rodent population due to immunological dynamics. The produced species distribution maps go some way towards explaining the observed limited geographic radiation of outbreaks of Lassa fever in this region and the slow spread of Lassa fever across space as reported elsewhere. We anticipate that this data will help inform higher resolution models of rodent distributions across West Africa. This may be of interest when investigating the effect of increasing development and land use change on rodent assemblages and in particular the hazard of Lassa fever outbreaks. Finally, these data highlight the need for comprehensive studies of rodent species assemblages elsewhere in the Lassa fever endemic zone to understand the generalisability of these findings and for future production of hazard hotspot maps for zoonotic pathogen spillover risk. 

# Introduction

# Research questions

I aim to address the following questions:   

  1. What rodent species are prevalent at the study sites and how are species assemblages structured?
  2. How do these species assemblages vary over space and are population structures associated with land use?
  3. What is the potential impact of climate and land use change on *Lassa mammarenavirus* spillover hazard?

# Methods

  * Trapping occurs at up to 6 sites at 4 villages in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone
  * Each trap is set and baited for 4 consecutive nights - trapping effort is maintained across site and visit
  * Rodents are euthanised, morphological measurements obtained and samples of tissue collected for molecular speciation
  * Land use is classified at both trap sites and exact location of each trap
  
## Rodent presence and species assemblages

  * Presence of individual rodent species is detected through a successful trapping event
  * Pseudo-absence of an individual is defined as no detection after 3,000 consecutive trap-nights at a study-site within a study village
  * A species assemblage is defined at multiple geographic scales as all species identified within a single study-site that shares a habitat type in addition to at the village level and collection of habitat types.
  * The structure of a species assemblage includes description of the proportion of male and female individuals and their age classification (e.g. juvenile, adult).

## Rodent species assemblages and land use

  * Relative abundance of a species in different land use types will be reported - consistent trapping effort will support this estimate in the absence of mark-recapture-release studies which are not suitable due to concerns about Lassa infection of rodents at the study sites.
  * The change in these assemblage by season will be explored and associated with remote sensed environmental data such as NDVI, ground temperature, isothermality and precipitation
  * Species distribution maps will be produced for each identified species with sufficient data. 
  * These distributions will be examined to investigate the potential role of competition between species at study sites where absence or abundance is less than would be expected based on these distribution maps (i.e. mus or rattus displacing mastomys from suitable habitats)
  
## Impact of climate or land use change on rodent distributions

  * Using projected land use change/climate change what impact will this have on selected rodent species(i.e. rattus, mus and mastomys)

# Results

## Summary of trapping effort and rodent descriptives

  * Potentially this will go in the methods?
  
## Rodent presence and species assemblage structure

  * Description of presence/pseudo-absence of species across study site and habitat type by season
  * Describe the assemblages of different species across study site and habitat type by season
  
## Rodent species assemblages and land use
  
  * Model seasonal change in a) relative abundance of all rodents and b) number of species by seasonal indicators and proportions of different land use types as covariates
  * Species distribution maps will be produced
  * Difference between observed and expected will be investigated by comparing to observations of other species within these distributions
  
## Impact of climate or land use change on rodent distributions

  * Apply these species distribution models to expected future scenarios

Rodents are trapped at up to 6 distinct trap sites per village with up to 49 traps per site. Data was previously collected on this group of [data collection forms](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yE_JAThq-DM9y5yvtSPMgM2ezMcZ_zyO?usp=sharing). Since June 2021 all data has been collected on digitised versions using electronic pads/phones in the field through the [ODK](https://opendatakit.lshtm.ac.uk/lshtm-odk-servers/) platform all digital forms are encrypted locally on the device and sent to a server hosted at LSHTM. The `.xlsx` versions of the ODK forms are available on the OpenScience Framework [project page](https://osf.io/usjrd/).

`r nrow(final_cleaned_trap_data$clean_sites` trap nights across these visits have been completed. Study visits are scheduled four times per year (every 3 months).

Remote sensed land use classifications derived from Jung et al. and ground-truthed through input from local communities guided the selection of the trapping sites at the selected study villages. First landuse classifications for the Lassa virus endemic region of Eastern Sierra Leone was mapped with the distribution of different land classifications visualised to aid selection of adequate coverage of land types (Figure 1.). The study region was the environs of Kenema, seen as the purple region in the lower left part of the map. Subsequently the land use classifications of each study village was matched to identify potential sites to produce adequate coverage by village (Figure 2-7).

```{r eastern-province-landuse, layout = "l-page", fig.cap = "Figure 1. Land use classification of the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. **(L)** the proportion of different land use types and **(R)** a map of land use."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "figures", "landuse_plots", "eastern_province_combined_landuse_plots.png"))
```

The first study village was Lalehun, a village north of Kenema, on the road between Panguma and Tonga. This village of ~1,000 inhabitants is surrounded by agricultural land with seasonal crop production. Some areas of secondary forest and fallow land remain and are the location of cultivation of cacao or used for bushmeat hunting. 

```{r lalehun-landuse, layout = "l-page", fig.cap = "Figure 2. Land use classification around Lalehun"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "figures", "landuse_plots", "lalehun_combined_landuse_plots.png"))
```

Seven trap sites have been used at this village.

  1. 
  2. 
  3. 
  4.
  5. 
  6. 
  7. 

The trap locations are shown overlayed on these habitat maps below.

The proportion of nights trapping in each habitat gave good coverage of land use types in Eastern Sierra Leone.

```

The trap success rate is around 4% this is fairly acceptable based on the review I did. We have trapped 137 rodents from at least 13 species. The majority of trapped individuals have been shrews (crocidura), *Mastomys sp.*, *Praomys sp.*, *Mus minutoides* and *Lophuromys sp.*. Data from the most recent trapping activities from visit 3 during the rainy season have so far shown a dramatic drop in trap success.

knitr::include_graphics(here("reports", "figures", "species_caught.png"))
```

Species accumulation curves have been produced for the first two visits from Lalehun and Seilama. It has not been possible to produce equivalent plots for Baiama and Lambayama due to the low number of individuals/species trapped in those locations. 

```{r, layout = "l-page"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("reports", "figures", "species_accumulation.png"))
```

As we catch an increasing number of individuals we are seeing them clustering within expected habitats.
