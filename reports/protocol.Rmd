## Preparation for field work

Before going to the field it's important the following are checked

  1. Adequate number of clean and functioning Sherman traps are brought. You will need at least *324* to set up the correct number so please bring some extra.
  2. Enough sample pots for rodent specimens
  3. Spare batteries for GPS devices
  4. Battery packs if possible for the electronic tablets
  5. Working portable freezer that can be stored at Panguma Hospital Lab
  6. Paper copies of the data entry form in case the pads stop working
