The villages currently being sampled are Lalehun (coordinates  8.1975 N, -11.0803 E) and Seilama (coordinates 8.1222 N, -11.1936 E). Rodents are trapped at up to 6 distinct trap sites per village with up to 49 traps per site. Data is collected on this group of [data collection forms](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yE_JAThq-DM9y5yvtSPMgM2ezMcZ_zyO?usp=sharing) or on the digitised versions using electronic pads in the field through the [ODK](https://opendatakit.lshtm.ac.uk/lshtm-odk-servers/) server based at LSHTM.

Currently two visits to each village study site have occurred:
  + Lalehun
    + Visit 1 - 2020-11-30 to 2020-12-03
    + Visit 2 - 2021-04-01 to 2021-04-04
  + Seilama
    + Visit 1 - 2020-12-05 to 2020-12-09
    + Visit 2 - 2021-04-12 to 2021-04-15
There will ideally be study visits 4 times per year (roughly every 3 months)

The land use around the selected villages guided the selection of the trapping sites.
